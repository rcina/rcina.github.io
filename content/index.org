* About
- This is just a simple personal website to document stuff I am interested in. Stuff like technology, computer science, math, and programming interest me.
  At the moment some of the languages I am familiar with are Python, Java, C and JavaScript. I also have an interest in Emacs and using BSD unix and Linux operating systems.
