* About
- This is just a simple personal website to document stuff I am interested in. Stuff like technology, computer science, math, and programming continue to be things
  I like to pursue. At the moment some of the languages I am trying to get better at are Python, Java, C and JavaScript. Web development is something that I have
  set as a goal to learn someday. Besides the aforementioned items, I use Emacs for programming and writing because it is so extensible.  Furthermore, I enjoy using
  BSD (Unix) and Linux operating systems because they are free and open source.
