<li>This is just a simple personal website to document stuff I am interested in. Stuff like technology, computer science, math, and programming continue to be things
I like to pursue. At the moment some of the languages I am seeking to get better at are Python, Java, C and JavaScript. Web development is something that I have
set as a goal to learn someday. Besides the aforementioned items, I also use Emacs for programming and writing because it is very extensible. It might not be as
popular as Visual Studio Code is these days because of it's learning curve to master but it has so many things that make it worthwhile investment to learn in the
long run.  Beyond it's editing capabilities Emacs has so many features it's pretty much impossible to learn them all. One feature that I find indispensable is
Org Mode. It is like a swiss-army knife of functionality that allows making notes, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming, and
maintaining to-do lists. There is a plethora of things to learn with Emacs to keep one busy for a lifetime.</li>
<li>I enjoy using BSD (Unix) and Linux operating systems because they are free and open source. These operating systems have great user communities and are essential
for most of my computing activities. I have been using some form of BSD or Linux system since the early 2000's.</li>
